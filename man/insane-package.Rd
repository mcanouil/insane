\title{insane: INsulin Secretion ANalysEr}
\description{
A user-friendly interface, using Shiny, to analyse glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) 
    assays in pancreatic beta cells or islets.
    The package allows the user to import several sets of experiments from different spreadsheets 
    and to perform subsequent steps: summarise in a tidy format, visualise data quality 
    and compare experimental conditions without omitting to account for technical confounders 
    such as the date of the experiment or the technician.
    Together, insane is a comprehensive method that optimises pre-processing and analyses of 
    GSIS experiments in a friendly-user interface.
    The Shiny App was initially designed for EndoC-betaH1 cell line following method described 
    in Ndiaye et al., 2017 (<doi:10.1016/j.molmet.2017.03.011>).
